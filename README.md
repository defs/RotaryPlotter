# RotaryPlotter

This project comprises the code to opperate a rotary plotter, akin to an X-Y Plotter, designed from scratch, for fun. The basic electronic components of the code include the following: 

1. Rasberry Pi (Running Processing 3.0.1)
2. Arduino Uno (Connected to the Rasberry Pi via serial; communication via Processing)
3. 2x FEMA 17 Stepper Motors (Driven by EasyDriver stepper motor drivers)
4. 1x Servo Motor

To be functional, the project should include 2 code components (Processing Code; Arduino Code) along with the various STL 3D Printed files. There will also be various test images and files as needed. 

Ultimately, I would like to include code for the Rasberry Pi to enable image capture, processing, and printing.
